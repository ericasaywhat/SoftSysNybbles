# Nybbles: Wumpus Murdering, Battleship Sinking

### Erica Lee & Emily Yeh

#### Our Goal

Our main goal for this project is to gain a better understanding of C, especially with regards to using pointers and various C libraries. To achieve this goal, we will build a game with code that is object-oriented and memory- and runtime-efficient. The minimum viable product will be a game that includes a target enemy, a mechanism by which the player can shoot missiles, and a map displayed in the terminal on which the player can move.

#### Our Stretch Goals

Some stretch goals we have are to include text prompts and target and player movement. For now, we have everything we need to get started (mainly, the internet and the Head First C book). However, it is definitely possible that we will run into difficulties that will require other resources that we will not be able to find on the internet, at which point, we will consult Allen or Serena.
 
#### What's Next?
 
Our first steps include researching any libraries we need and implementing a simple version of the game. Our MVP is complete when we have a 2D array representative of the gameâ€™s map and a target that resides somewhere in the array, which the player can shoot.
